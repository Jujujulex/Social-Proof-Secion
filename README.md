# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section design

This is a solution to the [Social proof section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA).

This challenge has helped me improve my coding skills by building a realistic project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## Knowledge gained

- grid layout
- flexbox layout
- more css properties
- how to properly structure HTML to enable accurate targetting of any given element.

### The Achieved Result

I was able to:

- Designed an optimal layout for the section depending on your device's screen size

### What I learned

The major challenge was finding the exact css property that will give me the expected result. I discovered some css property works better when combined with other css properties. In the example below, I noticed using only one of the properties had no effect.

```css
.container .section1 {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  row-gap: 0.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to get acquitted with flexbox and css grid. There seems to be more to learn about their usage and I will be learning more about them.
